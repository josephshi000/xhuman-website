  <h1>About xHuman</h1>

  <p>
    xHuman is a platform-focused company based in Canada, dedicated to building
    scalable interactive systems designed for long-term operation and collaboration.
    The company approaches interactive technology from a system and infrastructure
    perspective rather than isolated product development.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman’s vision is to enable interactive systems that remain usable, maintainable,
    and extensible over long periods of time. We believe future interactive experiences
    require platform-level thinking, clear architectural boundaries, and sustainable
    operational models.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>
    We focus on system design principles that prioritize reliability, scalability,
    and collaboration. By separating edge responsibilities from centralized logic,
    xHuman enables consistent behavior while reducing complexity at the device level.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Platform-first system architecture</li>
    <li>Clear interface and responsibility boundaries</li>
    <li>Long-term operability over short-term optimization</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Collaboration Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman works with partners who value clear scope definition, technical transparency,
    and long-term collaboration. Our platform is designed to support joint development,
    integration, and commercialization while maintaining clear ownership and operational
    boundaries.
  </p>

  <h2>Company Information</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman operates as an independent platform company. Further details regarding
    technical documentation, roadmap, and collaboration scope can be shared with
    qualified partners upon request.
