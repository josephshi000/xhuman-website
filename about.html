  <h1>About xHuman</h1>

  <p>
    xHuman is a Canada-based company centered on building platform-level capabilities.
    We focus on creating scalable interactive systems designed for long-term operation and collaborative delivery.
    We approach interactive technology from a systems and infrastructure perspective,
    rather than treating it as short-term development of isolated products.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman’s vision is to ensure that interactive systems remain usable, maintainable, and extensible over long time horizons.
    We believe future interactive experiences must be built on platform-level thinking,
    clear architectural boundaries, and sustainable operational models.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>
    We emphasize reliability, scalability, and collaboration-friendly system design principles.
    By clearly separating edge-side responsibilities from centralized logic,
    xHuman reduces device-side complexity while maintaining consistent system behavior.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Platform-first system architecture</li>
    <li>Clear interfaces and responsibility boundaries</li>
    <li>Long-term operability prioritized over short-term optimization</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Collaboration Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman works with partners who value well-defined scope, technical transparency, and long-term collaboration.
    The platform is designed to support joint development, integration, and commercialization,
    while maintaining clear intellectual property ownership and operational boundaries.
  </p>

  <h2>Company Information</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman operates as an independent platform company.
    Further information on technical documentation, roadmaps, and collaboration scope
    can be provided on a need-to-know basis after engagement with qualified partners.
