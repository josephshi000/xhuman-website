    <h2>System Patent Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>A Physical Event Closed-Loop System Based on Low-Power Event Nodes and Methods Thereof</strong></p>

    <h3>1. What Problem Does This System Solve?</h3>
    <p>
      Most existing IoT systems, wearable systems, tracking systems, or so-called “intelligent systems”
      are built on a fundamental assumption:
      the system must continuously sense, stay continuously online, and continuously make judgments
      in order to be “responsible” for the real world.
    </p>
    <p>This assumption directly causes the following structural issues at the system level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The system relies on devices continuously uploading data, making power, bandwidth, and scale uncontrollable;</li>
      <li>Judgment, risk, and liability are pushed down to devices or algorithms, creating unverifiable compliance risks;</li>
      <li>Once an event is reported, it is treated as “true,” lacking confirmation and closure;</li>
      <li>Systems are difficult to reuse across scenarios; different applications often require re-designing devices and rules;</li>
      <li>Failure of a single device or function leads to rapid decay in overall system value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Existing systems are good at “seeing the world,” but cannot reliably “confirm what truly happened.”
      This invention does not try to make the system “smarter”—it redefines what counts as a “completed event.”
    </p>

    <h3>2. The Core Idea</h3>
    <p>
      This invention proposes a physical system architecture where an “event closed loop” is the minimal unit.
      The core idea is:
      the system is not based on “continuous sensing,” but on “verifiable events”;
      it is not centered on “algorithmic judgment,” but on “human confirmation” as the closure condition.
    </p>
    <p>Under this principle:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The system only recognizes events that complete the closed loop;</li>
      <li>Unconfirmed reports do not constitute system facts;</li>
      <li>Judgment, rules, risk, and responsibility reside entirely at the system level—not the device level.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. What Kind of System Is Proposed?</h3>
    <p>
      This invention is not limited to a specific application.
      It is a reusable event closed-loop system architecture applicable to many physical-world scenarios.
      The system includes at least:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple low-power physical event nodes (Event Nodes);</li>
      <li>At least one system-side event coordination unit;</li>
      <li>At least one human confirmation and acknowledgement channel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the system, an event becomes valid only if it follows the closed-loop path:<br />
      <strong>Event Occurs → System Prompts → Human Confirms → Status Acknowledgement</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The system does not automatically judge whether an event is “important.”
      It only ensures whether the event is confirmed and closed.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Full Decoupling of System Duties and Device Duties</h3>
    <p>In this invention:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device layer:</strong> only triggers events, outputs prompts, and captures confirmation;</li>
      <li><strong>System layer:</strong> orchestrates events, escalations, correlations, and maintains state;</li>
      <li><strong>Rules layer:</strong> interprets event meaning, evaluates risk, and defines response strategy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Devices cannot form conclusions on their own, and the system does not bypass confirmation to declare facts.
      Structurally, this separation prevents algorithmic misjudgment from becoming system decisions,
      prevents device errors from turning into liability conclusions,
      and prevents single devices from becoming systemic risk sources.
    </p>

    <h3>5. A “Verifiable Event Network,” Not a Data Network</h3>
    <p>Most existing systems follow this model:</p>
    <p><strong>Data Collection → Data Upload → Algorithm Analysis → Output Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>This invention follows a different model:</p>
    <p><strong>Event Trigger → Human-Perceivable Prompt → Human Confirmation → System Records Fact</strong></p>
    <p>In this system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data is not the core;</li>
      <li>Continuous sensing is not a prerequisite;</li>
      <li>Confirmation behavior is the most important signal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Escalation and Persistence for Unclosed Events</h3>
    <p>This invention explicitly defines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unconfirmed events are not considered complete;</li>
      <li>The system may escalate uncompleted events based on rules;</li>
      <li>Escalation can include repeated prompts, widening the notification scope, or involving other nodes/people;</li>
      <li>An event remains “open” until confirmation closes it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The system does not “decide for people,” but it does not let unconfirmed events disappear.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Essential Differences from Existing Systems</h3>
    <p><strong>Conventional systems:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Core: data and sensing</li>
      <li>Mode: always online, continuous uploading</li>
      <li>Event validity: reporting equals validity</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This invention:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Core: events and confirmation</li>
      <li>Mode: offline-first, event-driven</li>
      <li>Event validity: confirmation equals validity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Physical-World Event Scenarios Covered</h3>
    <p>This invention is industry-agnostic and can apply to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Companion and caregiving systems for children and seniors;</li>
      <li>Luggage, item, and asset state-confirmation systems;</li>
      <li>Regulatory systems that require “recording facts without automatic labeling”;</li>
      <li>Group activities, organizations, collaboration, and temporary relationship systems;</li>
      <li>Other physical systems with strict requirements on power, misjudgment risk, and liability boundaries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. Why This System Can Evolve Long-Term Without Becoming Obsolete</h3>
    <p>Because the invention is not bound to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any specific sensor;</li>
      <li>Any specific communication protocol;</li>
      <li>Any specific application form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It binds to one thing only: <strong>whether an event completes a closed loop</strong>.
      As applications, form factors, and technologies evolve, rules can evolve too—
      without reconstructing the closed-loop event structure.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Technical Value Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Builds reliable system-level facts even under ultra-low power and offline conditions;</li>
      <li>Does not depend on device intelligence, reducing misjudgment and compliance risk;</li>
      <li>Enables long-term existence and reuse of large-scale physical nodes;</li>
      <li>Structurally isolates judgment, risk, and liability;</li>
      <li>Provides foundational architecture for “systematizing events in the physical world.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary Definition</h3>
    <p>
      This invention defines a physical system architecture where the “event closed loop” is the minimal unit.
      By externalizing judgment and responsibility away from the device layer,
      it enables a verifiable, scalable, and reusable physical-world event system under offline-first and low-power conditions.

  <!-- ===== Core Module Patent Introduction (All 10 Statements) ===== -->
  <section style="max-width: 860px; margin: 32px auto; line-height: 1.8;">

    <h2>Core Module Patent Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>An Embedded Physical-Entity Node Core Module with an Ultra-Low-Power Event Closed Loop and Methods Thereof</strong></p>

    <h3>1. What Problem Does This Invention Solve?</h3>
    <p>
      Most low-power nodes, tags, wearables, or so-called “smart terminals” are built on the same assumption:
      the device must remain continuously online, or must have some level of “local intelligence” for the system to work.
    </p>
    <p>This leads to long-standing problems that have not been structurally solved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To “seem useful,” devices are forced to stay online or communicate frequently, making power consumption uncontrollable;</li>
      <li>Devices take on judgment/interpretation/decision duties; a misjudgment creates safety, compliance, and liability risks;</li>
      <li>If the device goes offline, runs out of power, or is replaced, functionality breaks and historical value cannot accumulate;</li>
      <li>The same core is repeatedly asked to “add features” across applications, causing board changes, renegotiation, and poor reusability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This invention does not optimize within those paths—it takes a fundamentally different path.</strong></p>

    <h3>2. The Core Idea</h3>
    <p>
      It demotes the core from an “intelligent agent” into an “event node,”
      removing intelligence, judgment, and relationships from the device entirely,
      keeping only the minimal “event → prompt → confirmation” closed-loop capability on the core.
    </p>

    <h3>3. What Kind of Core Module Is Proposed?</h3>
    <p>
      This invention does not propose a “smarter core,” but a low-power physical-entity node core module
      with strictly frozen responsibilities. It only does three things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Generate events (button triggers, abnormal impact, environmental changes, wake-ups, etc.);</li>
      <li>Execute prompts (fixed prompts frozen in advance, such as voice / buzzer / vibration);</li>
      <li>Receive and report confirmation (whether the user confirms, via physical input).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Beyond that, the core makes no judgments, does not interpret event meaning, and does not form conclusions.
    </p>

    <h3>4. How This Core Achieves “Long-Term Ultra-Low Power”</h3>
    <p>This invention does not save power via “low-power algorithms,” but via structural design:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The core defaults to deep sleep;</li>
      <li>Only an always-on domain remains (RTC and wake logic);</li>
      <li>It wakes briefly only when an event triggers or an external instruction arrives;</li>
      <li>After handling, it forcibly shuts down the communication, display, and expansion domains and returns to sleep.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Not “compute less,” but “most of the time it does not work at all.”</strong></p>

    <h3>5. A Real “Event Closed Loop,” Not Feature Stacking</h3>
    <p><strong>Event → Prompt → Confirmation → Acknowledgement</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>An event without confirmation does not form a closed loop;</li>
      <li>An event without closure is not treated as a “completed event”;</li>
      <li>Deciding whether it is “important,” “dangerous,” or “requires action” is never done on the core.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Essential Differences from Existing Technology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device role:</strong> Existing tech acts as smart terminals or sensing devices; this invention is explicitly an Event Node.</li>
      <li><strong>Operating assumption:</strong> Existing tech relies on always-online polling/continuous sensing; this invention defaults to deep sleep and works only on events/commands.</li>
      <li><strong>Functional boundary:</strong> Existing devices include judgment and conclusions; this core only executes event, prompt, and confirmation.</li>
      <li><strong>Event validity:</strong> Existing tech often treats “reporting as truth”; this invention uses a verifiable closed loop.</li>
      <li><strong>Liability boundary:</strong> Existing judgment is coupled to the device; here rules and judgment are fully externalized.</li>
      <li><strong>Power model:</strong> High-frequency comms/continuous sensing vs offline-first + power-domain shutdown.</li>
      <li><strong>System role:</strong> Single-device value decays over time vs long-term reuse as a system node.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Applicable Scenarios for Low-Power Physical Nodes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dolls and companion physical nodes;</li>
      <li>Airport luggage tags, important-item tags, or logistics tags;</li>
      <li>Carriers that require state confirmation but cannot make autonomous judgments (e.g., ankle-monitor-like carriers);</li>
      <li>Other scenarios with strict requirements on power, misjudgment risk, and liability boundaries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Why the Same Core Works Across Completely Different Form Factors</h3>
    <p>
      Because this invention never defines the core as a specific product.
      Here, the core is simply a <strong>low-power, offline-first physical node that only produces events and confirmations</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Form factors can change; responsibilities must not.</strong></p>

    <h3>9. Fundamental Difference from Existing Low-Power Node/Tag Patents</h3>
    <p>Existing solutions typically fall into patterns like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low power + local judgment</li>
      <li>Low power + continuous tracking</li>
      <li>Low power + simplified intelligence</li>
      <li>Or purely as a communication node</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This invention does not pursue local intelligence, does not require always-online behavior,
      and does not try to “understand the world.”
      It only guarantees that events are real, prompts are perceivable, and confirmation is verifiable.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Technical Value Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Forms a reliable event closed loop under ultra-low power;</li>
      <li>The core stands alone and does not depend on any specific platform;</li>
      <li>Long-term reuse across completely different applications;</li>
      <li>Structurally removes risk, judgment, and liability from the device layer;</li>
      <li>Provides a replicable, scalable foundational unit for large-scale physical-node systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This invention defines an embedded physical-entity node core that
      <strong>“only handles events and does not carry intelligence.”</strong>
      It provides a verifiable, scalable, reusable hardware foundation for long-lived systems under low-power constraints.
