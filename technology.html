  <h1>Technology</h1>
  <p>
    xHuman is built on a system-level architecture designed for reliability, scalability,
    and long-term operation. The platform emphasizes a clear separation of responsibilities
    between edge entities and centralized logic, enabling consistent and stable system behavior
    without requiring edge-side devices to remain continuously online.
  </p>

  <h2>System Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The core technical principle of xHuman is an “event-driven + cloud orchestration” system model.
    Interactive entities operate as responsibility-constrained nodes that continuously generate discrete events;
    the platform processes these events centrally to maintain system consistency and long-term state continuity.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Event-driven design:</strong> The system responds to key events rather than relying on continuous polling or persistent connections.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend-managed, cloud-controlled state handling:</strong> System state, rules, and historical records are centrally maintained by the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient edge operation:</strong> Edge entities run at low power and承担 only the minimum required responsibilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reliability and Continuity</h2>
  <p>
    The platform tolerates intermittent network connectivity and partial system unavailability.
    By treating events as persistent system inputs, xHuman supports failure recovery, event replay,
    and state reconstruction—without requiring every entity to be always online or continuously running.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Graceful handling of offline or delayed nodes</li>
    <li>System state reconstruction through event replay</li>
    <li>Consistent behavior maintained after system restarts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scalability</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman’s architecture supports horizontal scaling across entity count, user scale,
    and deployment scenarios. The system enables gradual growth and incremental iteration
    without significantly increasing operational complexity on the edge side.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Unified management of large numbers of collaborative entities</li>
    <li>Clear interface boundaries that support extension and secondary development</li>
    <li>Platform-level updates without repeated redeployment of edge logic</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security and Data Boundaries</h2>
  <p>
    Security and data responsibility are treated as first-class design objectives.
    Sensitive logic, state, and policy execution are centralized in the cloud,
    reducing the attack surface and simplifying compliance,
    while providing clear integration boundaries for partners.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Minimal data storage on the edge side</li>
    <li>Centralized access control and audit mechanisms</li>
    <li>Clear separation between operational data and partner integration data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    The xHuman platform is supported by a layered intellectual property strategy
    that covers system architecture, operational methods, and integration boundaries.
    This strategy enables collaboration with partners while strengthening long-term defensibility
    and sustainable competitive advantage for the platform.
