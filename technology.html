  <h1>Technology</h1>
  <p>
    xHuman is built on a system-level architecture designed for reliability,
    scalability, and long-term operation. The platform prioritizes clear
    separation of responsibilities between edge entities and centralized logic,
    enabling consistent behavior without requiring continuous operation at the edge.
  </p>

  <h2>System Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The core technical principle behind xHuman is an event-driven, cloud-orchestrated
    model. Interactive entities operate as bounded nodes that generate discrete events.
    These events are processed centrally to maintain system consistency and long-term
    state continuity.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Event-driven design:</strong> The system reacts to meaningful events rather than relying on constant polling or continuous connectivity.</li>
    <li><strong>Centralized state management:</strong> System state, rules, and history are maintained at the platform level.</li>
    <li><strong>Edge efficiency:</strong> Edge entities are optimized for low-power operation and limited responsibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reliability and Continuity</h2>
  <p>
    The platform is designed to tolerate intermittent connectivity and partial system
    availability. By treating events as durable system inputs, xHuman supports recovery,
    replay, and state reconstruction without requiring persistent online presence from
    every entity.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Graceful handling of offline or delayed nodes</li>
    <li>Event replay for state reconstruction</li>
    <li>Consistent behavior across system restarts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scalability</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman is designed to scale horizontally across entities, users, and deployments.
    The architecture supports incremental expansion without increasing operational
    complexity at the edge.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Support for large numbers of coordinated entities</li>
    <li>Clear interface boundaries for system extension</li>
    <li>Platform-level updates without redeploying edge logic</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security and Data Boundaries</h2>
  <p>
    Security and data responsibility are treated as first-class design concerns.
    Sensitive logic, state, and policy enforcement are centralized, reducing the
    attack surface and simplifying compliance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Minimal data retention at the edge</li>
    <li>Centralized access control and auditing</li>
    <li>Clear separation between operational data and partner integrations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    The xHuman platform is supported by a layered intellectual property strategy
    covering system architecture, operational methods, and integration boundaries.
    This approach reinforces long-term defensibility while remaining compatible
    with partner collaboration.
