  <h1>Platform</h1>
  <p>
    xHuman is building a platform for scalable interactive systems. The goal is to enable
    reliable coordination across multiple interactive entities while maintaining clear system
    boundaries and long-term operability.
  </p>

  <h2>Platform Capabilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-entity coordination:</strong> Support coordinated behavior across multiple nodes under a single system model.</li>
    <li><strong>Event-driven operation:</strong> Capture discrete events and process them centrally for consistency and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud orchestration:</strong> Centralized logic for state, rules, and long-term continuity.</li>
    <li><strong>Management & monitoring:</strong> Visibility into devices, events, system status, and operational health.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration-ready:</strong> Designed for partner collaboration across hardware, software, and content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>System Components</h2>
  <p>
    The platform is organized around three practical layers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Entities / Nodes:</strong> Interactive edge units that generate events and perform bounded actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Platform:</strong> Processes events, enforces system rules, and maintains consistent system state.</li>
    <li><strong>Console & Operations:</strong> Admin tools for configuration, observability, and lifecycle management.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Collaboration Model</h2>
  <p>
    xHuman is built for long-term collaboration with partners. Typical cooperation paths include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technology integration:</strong> Partner devices, SDKs, or servi
