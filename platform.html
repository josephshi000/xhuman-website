  <h2>Chapter 0 — How to Read This (Investor Guidance)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This is not a single toy product. It is a long-term operable, continuously extensible <strong>doll platform system</strong>.</li>
    <li>This round is to execute an already-defined system plan, not to “test whether the idea works.”</li>
    <li>The project has completed incorporation, trademark and patent layout, and has a complete product + system architecture definition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dolls are not decorations: a system world that becomes “smarter” over time</h2>
  <p>
    This section helps investors understand: the Swarm Doll World Platform is not a one-time feature bundle,
    but a system with long-term evolution space.
  </p>

  <h3>1) Clear up a common misunderstanding</h3>
  <p>
    The dolls in this platform are not display items, nor one-time interactive electronic toys.
    In the system they are defined as <strong>“role nodes”</strong>, and their capabilities are not permanently “written at factory time.”
  </p>

  <h3>2) What “getting smarter” truly means</h3>
  <p>
    “Smarter” does not mean the doll itself is learning, nor does it mean running heavy AI inside the doll.
    What evolves is the <strong>world</strong>:
    the platform continuously improves its understanding of historical events, group behaviors, and long-term patterns,
    and therefore issues more appropriate behavior decisions.
  </p>
  <p><strong>In short:</strong> the doll stays simple; the world becomes smarter.</p>

  <h3>3) An intuitive evolution path</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> the system only understands basic patterns (e.g., how often a doll is triggered).</li>
    <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> it learns relationships between behaviors; different dolls show differentiated reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> it understands the “phase” of the entire world; new dolls can naturally join the existing world.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What gets smarter is the “world”; the dolls are the body of that world.</strong></p>

  <h3>4) Why this evolution is sustainable</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No hardware upgrade dependency:</strong> capability improves via platform rules/models, not replacing dolls.</li>
    <li><strong>No always-online dependency:</strong> evolution comes from long-term event accumulation, not real-time heavy compute.</li>
    <li><strong>Scale increases stability:</strong> more dolls → richer history → more reliable system decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5) What this means for investment value</h3>
  <p>
    Long-term value does not depend on one generation’s doll sales, but on how much history and rules the world accumulates.
    This creates a <strong>“more usage → more value”</strong> property, instead of “sell and end.”
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 1 — One sentence: what we are building</h2>
  <p>
    The Swarm Doll World Platform is a system that allows multiple dolls to coexist in the same <strong>“world”</strong>.
    Even if each doll sleeps or goes offline most of the time, the world continues to run and evolve.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 2 — Market-validated background (Labubu reference)</h2>
  <p>
    Trend dolls represented by Labubu have achieved millions of units in sales, proving demand exists.
    However, the mainstream model is still a one-time sale:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Value is mostly fixed after purchase</li>
    <li>User engagement weakens over time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not deny this success. We extend the question:
    can dolls become <strong>persistent roles</strong>, not only collectibles?
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 3 — Core innovation: a system that lets dolls “live”</h2>
  <p>
    The innovation is not in more complex hardware, but in a fundamentally different system approach:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The world matters more than a single doll</li>
    <li>Dolls do not need to be always online</li>
    <li>What happened does not disappear</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Result: dolls can sleep, but the world persists; users don’t just “own a doll,” they participate in a world.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 4 — How this differs from normal toys / AI toys</h2>
  <p>Normal toys / AI toys focus on: <strong>“How smart is one toy?”</strong></p>
  <p>This platform focuses on: <strong>“Can a world persist long-term and continuously evolve?”</strong></p>

  <h3>Normal toys</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Single doll is the主体 (main body)</li>
    <li>Often relies on continuous online presence</li>
    <li>Power off = stops</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Swarm Doll World Platform</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The world is the主体 (main body)</li>
    <li>Dolls can remain offline long-term</li>
    <li>The world continues evolving</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is not a feature upgrade; it is a paradigm change with high replication cost.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 5 — How it is implemented (non-technical)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>All doll behaviors are recorded as events</li>
    <li>The platform continuously computes world state from event history</li>
    <li>Dolls wake only when needed to execute simple instructions</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This yields low power, high stability, and long-term operability.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 6 — Foundation assets already in place</h2>
  <p><strong>Company:</strong> xHuman Ltd (incorporated)</p>

  <h3>IP Structure & Ownership</h3>
  <p>
    The platform’s value is not in any single codebase, algorithm instance, or hardware form,
    but in non-separable systemic assets:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>System paradigm-level design</li>
    <li>Structural definition of platform–core-module responsibility boundaries</li>
    <li>Architecture supporting long-term operation and scalable expansion</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.1 Purpose: why IP clarity is critical</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What IP already exists as original assets</li>
    <li>What new IP may be created during co-development</li>
    <li>What core IP must never be transferred, split, or separately licensed</li>
    <li>How partners gain predictable economic upside without breaking platform integrity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.2 Pre-existing IP</h3>
  <h4>6.2.1 Patents (filed)</h4>
  <p>As of submission date, patents filed before any cooperation/funding:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>China (3):</strong> 2026100001670, 2026100553835, 202620052673X</li>
    <li>Low-power doll core structure</li>
    <li>Event-driven multi-node interaction method</li>
    <li>Group state + historical event replay mechanism</li>
    <li><strong>Canada (1):</strong> 3297390 (platform system invention)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These patents and derivative rights are <strong>Background IP</strong> and do not transfer or become jointly owned.
  </p>

  <h4>6.2.2 Trademarks & brand</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>China: xHuman word mark</li>
    <li>China: xHuman graphic mark</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All marks/branding and derivative rights do not transfer or become jointly owned or implicitly licensed through cooperation.
  </p>

  <h3>6.3 Non-separable core IP</h3>
  <h4>6.3.1 Scope of “core IP”</h4>
  <p>Core IP includes but is not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>System paradigm and overall architecture (responsibility allocation, operating assumptions)</li>
    <li>Group state engine computation model and logic structure</li>
    <li>Event-driven + event replay as the system core mechanism</li>
    <li>Platform–core-module boundary constraints</li>
    <li>Non-real-time, delay-tolerant operational model</li>
    <li>Architecture documents, algorithm designs, protocol definitions, interface specs directly related to above</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> core IP is defined by structure & rules, not a particular code implementation.</p>

  <h4>6.3.2 Non-separability principles</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Core IP may not be separately licensed, sold, or split</li>
    <li>No licensing/transfer of a module out of system context</li>
    <li>Core IP may not be used in any competing system/product (directly or indirectly)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.4 Foreground IP from co-development</h3>
  <h4>6.4.1 Default ownership</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>System-level成果 (architecture, algorithm logic, platform mechanisms) → owned by xHuman Ltd</li>
    <li>Implementation成果 (code, configs, deployment scripts) → owned by xHuman Ltd as part of the integrated system</li>
    <li>Partners do not gain ownership or independent usage rights by “doing development”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This ownership structure is the prerequisite for a <strong>tech-for-equity</strong> model.</p>

  <h4>6.4.2 Reasonable partner rights (without violating core IP)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Participate via equity and share long-term platform value</li>
    <li>Showcase cooperation case studies (within written agreement scope)</li>
    <li>Reuse their own general engineering know-how (non-competing)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.5 Rights explicitly NOT granted</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>❌ Independent use rights of core algorithms/system</li>
    <li>❌拆解 modules to commercialize separately</li>
    <li>❌ Reuse platform architecture in other doll/companion/group systems</li>
    <li>❌ Veto rights over roadmap/version evolution/product direction</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.6 IP handling in tech-for-equity scenarios (critical)</h3>
  <p>
    What is being “converted” is input value and shared risk — not the purchase of code/system/IP usage rights.
    All deliverables are treated as capital contribution; IP belongs to the company; partner rights are expressed as equity.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Strategic tech equity</strong> ≠ <strong>outsourcing + implicit licensing</strong></p>

  <h3>6.7 Patent & IP expansion strategy</h3>
  <h4>6.7.1 New patents ownership</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>All subsequent patents based on platform mechanisms/core definitions are filed under the company</li>
    <li>Partners may be inventors (if applicable) but not patent owners/co-owners</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6.7.2 Defensive & extension layout focus</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevent modular copying</li>
    <li>Prevent single-point bypass via hardware/software</li>
    <li>Cover system methods, operating mechanisms, role definitions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.8 Investor/M&A diligence advantages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear, verifiable core IP boundaries</li>
    <li>Not dependent on a single partner/supplier</li>
    <li>No code ownership ambiguity / implicit licensing risk</li>
    <li>Complete platform asset for acquisition/inheritance</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.9 Conclusion (IP statement)</h3>
  <p>
    The IP strategy is not to maximize short-term cooperation convenience,
    but to ensure the system paradigm and platform value cannot be split, copied, or diluted.
    Partners participate via equity, not via partial system control.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 7 — Product roadmap (V1–V3)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>V1:</strong> basic world system + small-scale doll testing</li>
    <li><strong>V2:</strong> multi-doll collaboration + rule expansion</li>
    <li><strong>V3:</strong> platformization, mass production, and market readiness</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Chapter 8 — Funding use & investment terms</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Fundraising target:</strong> USD 150,000<br />
    <strong>Equity offered:</strong> 20%
  </p>
  <p><strong>Funds used for:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Platform & App software development</li>
    <li>Doll core module modification & testing</li>
    <li>System tuning & small-batch pilot production</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The founder covers any shortfall in the first stage.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 9 — Why now</h2>
  <p>
    The project has completed legal and technical foundations and is in an <strong>execution</strong> stage, not a concept stage.
    This round enables:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Participation in the platform’s early stage</li>
    <li>Alignment with long-term system value</li>
    <li>Not merely one-time product profit</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Closing</h2>
  <p>
    The Swarm Doll World Platform is not a “sell and end” toy project.
    It is a doll-world system that can continuously grow.
    We seek investors who understand long-term value to move this platform forward.
