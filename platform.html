  <h1 style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Swarm-Style, Decentralized Event System</h1>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; color: #333;">
    <br />
    Company entity: <strong>xHuman Ltd</strong><br />
    Using a core module embedded into physical objects,
    the system connects people and things when events occur,
    allowing unrelated worlds to naturally link together.<br />
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 0 | Investor Reading Notes</h2>
  <p>This project is not a single toy product, but a long-term, continuously extensible core-module (doll) platform system.</p>
  <p>This round of investment is to execute the established system plan, not to validate whether the idea is feasible.</p>
  <p>The project has completed trademark and patent positioning and already has a complete product and system architecture definition.</p>

  <h2>A Doll Is Not Just Decoration: A System World That Becomes “Smarter Over Time”</h2>
  <p>This section helps investors understand: the swarm-style decentralized event system is not a one-time feature bundle, but a system with long-term room to evolve.</p>

  <h3>1. First, Clarify a Common Misunderstanding</h3>
  <p>The swarm-style decentralized event system is not a display piece, nor a one-off interactive electronic toy.</p>
  <p>In the system, dolls are defined as “character nodes,” and their capabilities are not permanently fixed at the factory.</p>

  <h3>2. What “Smarter Over Time” Really Means</h3>
  <p>“Smarter over time” does not mean the doll itself is learning, nor does it mean complex AI runs inside the doll.</p>
  <p>What continuously evolves is the platform world itself:</p>
  <p>The platform’s understanding of historical events, group behavior, and long-term patterns deepens over time, enabling more reasonable behavioral decisions.</p>
  <p>In other words:</p>
  <p><strong>The doll stays simple; the world keeps getting smarter.</strong></p>

  <h3>3. An Evolution Path You Can Imagine</h3>
  <p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> The system understands only basic behavior patterns, such as how frequently a doll is triggered.</p>
  <p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> The system begins to understand correlations between behaviors, and different dolls gradually show differentiated responses.</p>
  <p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> The system can determine what stage the entire world is in; newly added dolls can naturally integrate into the existing world.</p>
  <p><strong>What becomes smart is the “world”; the doll is simply the body of that world.</strong></p>

  <h3>4. Why This Evolution Is Sustainable</h3>
  <p><strong>First, it does not rely on hardware upgrades.</strong> Capability improvements come from platform rules and compute-model upgrades, not from replacing dolls.</p>
  <p><strong>Second, it does not rely on being always online.</strong> The system evolves through long-term event accumulation rather than real-time high-compute operation.</p>
  <p><strong>Third, greater scale makes the system more stable.</strong> The more dolls exist, the more complete the world history becomes, and the more reliable system judgments are.</p>

  <h3>5. What This Means for Investment Value</h3>
  <p>The long-term value of the swarm-style decentralized event system does not depend on sales of a single generation of dolls, but on how much history and how many rules the world accumulates.</p>
  <p>This means the platform has “increasing returns with usage,” rather than ending after a one-time sale.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 1 | One Sentence: What We Are Building</h2>
  <p>The swarm-style decentralized event system is a system where multiple dolls coexist in the same “world.”</p>
  <p>Even if each doll is asleep or offline most of the time, the world continues to operate and evolve.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 2 | Market-Validated Reality (The Labubu Case)</h2>
  <p>Trend dolls represented by Labubu have reached millions of units sold, proving the doll market is real.</p>
  <p>But the business model of most trend dolls is primarily one-time sales:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Once sold, the doll’s value is largely fixed</li>
    <li>User relationships weaken over time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This project does not deny that success. Instead, it extends the thinking:</p>
  <p>Can a doll become a “persistent character,” not just a collectible object?</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3 | Core Innovation: A System That Makes Dolls Feel “Alive”</h2>
  <p>The innovation is not more complex hardware—it is a fundamentally different system approach:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The world matters more than any single doll</li>
    <li>Dolls do not need to stay always online</li>
    <li>What happened does not disappear</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As a result:</p>
  <p>Dolls can sleep, but the world persists; users don’t just own a doll—they participate in a world.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 4 | The Fundamental Difference vs. Ordinary Toys / AI Toys</h2>
  <p>Ordinary toys / AI toys focus on: “How smart is one toy?”</p>
  <p>The swarm-style decentralized event system focuses on: “Can a world exist long-term and keep evolving?”</p>

  <h3>Ordinary Toys</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A single doll is the main subject</li>
    <li>Depends on always-online operation</li>
    <li>Stops when powered off</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Swarm-Style, Decentralized Event System</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The world is the main subject</li>
    <li>Dolls can be offline long-term</li>
    <li>The world continues to evolve</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This difference is not a feature upgrade—it is a paradigm difference, and the cost to replicate is extremely high.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 5 | How the Innovation Is Implemented (Non-Technical Version)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>All doll behaviors are recorded</li>
    <li>The platform continuously computes the world state from these records</li>
    <li>Dolls wake only when needed to execute simple commands</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This enables low power, high stability, and long-term operability.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 6 | Existing Foundational Assets</h2>
  <p>Company entity: xHuman Ltd</p>

  <h3>IP Structure & Ownership</h3>
  <p>
    The core value of the swarm-style decentralized event system is not contained in any single codebase,
    any single algorithm implementation, or any single hardware form factor,
    but in the following inseparable system-level assets:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>System paradigm-level design (System Paradigm)</li>
    <li>Structural definition of platform–core responsibility boundaries</li>
    <li>Overall architecture that supports long-term operation and scalable expansion</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.1 Purpose of This Chapter (Why IP Clarity Is Critical)</h3>
  <p>The purpose of this chapter is to clarify and solidify in advance the following key questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which IP already exists and constitutes the company’s original assets</li>
    <li>Which IP will be created during collaborative development</li>
    <li>Which core IP must never be transferred, split, or independently licensed under any circumstances</li>
    <li>How partners can obtain reasonable and predictable economic interests without damaging platform integrity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.2 Pre-existing IP</h3>
  <h4>6.2.1 Patent Assets</h4>
  <p>As of the submission date of this investment plan, the company has completed the following patent layout:</p>
  <p><strong>China (3 filings)</strong> 2026100001670, 2026100553835, 202620052673X</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Core module patent</li>
    <li>System patent</li>
    <li>Method patent</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Canada (1 filing)</strong> 3297390 (platform system-related invention patent)</p>
  <p>All of the above patents and derivative rights constitute the company’s background IP and will not be transferred or jointly owned due to any partnership relationship.</p>

  <h4>6.2.2 Trademarks and Brand Assets</h4>
  <p>China: xHuman logo trademark.</p>
  <p>All trademarks, brand identifiers, and derivative rights shall not be transferred, jointly owned, or implicitly licensed due to technical cooperation, joint development, or investment.</p>

  <h3>6.3 Non-separable Core Intellectual Property</h3>
  <h4>6.3.1 Scope Defined as “Core IP”</h4>
  <p>Core IP includes, but is not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>System paradigm and overall architecture design (including responsibility allocation and operating assumptions)</li>
    <li>Computation model and logical structure of the collective state engine</li>
    <li>End-to-end mechanisms centered on event-driven operation and event replay</li>
    <li>Definitions of responsibility boundaries and capability constraints between core module and platform</li>
    <li>Non-real-time, delay-tolerant system operating models</li>
    <li>Related architecture documents, algorithm designs, protocol definitions, and interface specifications</li>
  </ul>
  <p>📌 Core IP is defined by “system structure and rules,” not by any specific code implementation.</p>

  <h4>6.3.2 Non-separability Principle</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Core IP must not be independently licensed, sold, or split</li>
    <li>No module may be licensed or transferred outside the overall system context</li>
    <li>Core IP must not be used in any system or product that directly or indirectly competes with this platform</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.4 Foreground IP Created During Collaboration</h3>
  <h4>6.4.1 Default Ownership Principle</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>System-level outcomes (architecture design, algorithm logic, platform mechanisms): → owned by the company (xHuman Ltd)</li>
    <li>Implementation-level outcomes (code, configuration, deployment scripts): → as part of the overall system implementation, owned by the company</li>
    <li>Partners do not gain system ownership or independent usage rights merely by performing development work</li>
  </ul>
  <p>📌 This ownership principle is a prerequisite for “equity-for-technology / contribution-for-equity” models.</p>

  <h4>6.4.2 Reasonable Partner Interests</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Participate via equity and share long-term platform value</li>
    <li>Within a clearly agreed scope: publicly present collaboration cases as a platform technology partner</li>
    <li>Reuse their own general engineering capabilities and experience, provided it does not constitute competition</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.5 Rights Explicitly Excluded (What Partners Do NOT Obtain)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>❌ Independent usage rights to the platform’s core algorithms or system</li>
    <li>❌ Rights to (split) the architecture or modules and commercialize them separately</li>
    <li>❌ Rights to reuse this platform architecture in other dolls, companion systems, or collective systems</li>
    <li>❌ Veto rights over future technical roadmap, version evolution, or product direction</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.6 IP Handling Under an Equity-for-Technology Scenario (Critical)</h3>
  <p>What is being valued is the contribution, risk-sharing, and commitment—not the purchase of code, system, or IP usage rights.</p>
  <p>Under this model, all development outputs are treated as capital contributions to the company; IP is owned by the company; partner rights are reflected through equity—not through any form of IP carve-out or license split.</p>
  <p>This clause distinguishes: “strategic technology contribution for equity” ≠ “outsourced development + implicit licensing.”</p>

  <h3>6.7 Follow-on Patent and IP Expansion Strategy</h3>
  <h4>6.7.1 Ownership of New Patents</h4>
  <p>Any follow-on patents based on the swarm-style decentralized event system, its mechanisms, or core-role definitions shall be filed in the company’s name.</p>
  <p>Partners may be listed as inventors where legally applicable, but not as patent owners or co-owners.</p>

  <h4>6.7.2 Defensive and Extension Coverage</h4>
  <p>IP focus areas include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Preventing modular replication of the platform</li>
    <li>Preventing single-point bypass of hardware or software</li>
    <li>Covering system-level methods, operating mechanisms, and core-role definitions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.8 IP Clarity from an Investment & M&A Perspective</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear and verifiable core IP boundaries</li>
    <li>Not dependent on any single partner or supplier</li>
    <li>No unclear code ownership or implicit-licensing risk</li>
    <li>Complete platform assets—transferable and acquirable</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.9 Conclusion (IP Position Statement)</h3>
  <p>
    The IP strategy for the swarm-style decentralized event system is not designed to maximize short-term collaboration convenience,
    but to ensure the system paradigm and platform value are not split, copied, or diluted over the long run.
    Partners participate in platform growth through equity, not by splitting the system to obtain partial control.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 7 | Product Phase Plan (A–B)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A: Base world system + small-scale doll testing</li>
    <li>A: Multi-doll collaboration and rule expansion</li>
    <li>B: Platformization, mass production, and go-to-market readiness</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Chapter 8 | Use of Funds & Investment Proposal</h2>
  <p><strong>Fundraising target:</strong> CAD 500,000 (CAD 100,000 for exclusive provincial agency rights; no equity)</p>
  <p><strong>Equity offered:</strong> 5%</p>
  <p>Funds will primarily be used for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Platform and app software expansion</li>
    <li>Core module modification and testing for dolls</li>
    <li>System tuning and small-batch pilot production</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The founder will cover any shortfall in the first stage.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 9 | Why This Is Worth Joining Now</h2>
  <p>The project has completed its legal and technical foundations and is in an executable—not conceptual—stage.</p>
  <p>The value of this round is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Joining at the platform’s early stage</li>
    <li>Binding to long-term system value</li>
    <li>Not one-time product revenue</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Closing</h2>
  <p>
    The swarm-style decentralized event system is not a toy project that ends after sales—it is a doll-world system that can keep growing.
    We hope to work with investors who understand long-term value to advance this platform together.
